To run the code:
java -jar App.jar

This will give us the first page of the application.
Main controller acts as the starting point. When the program loads, we are given two options:
1 - Login
2 - Signup

Enter the email id of the user in login followed by the password. This will be validated against the database and then will lead to the home page of the user.

Then we have custom options in the individual home pages of the users(employees or customer)
